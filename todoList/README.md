#This project is a simple task control. The changed files from the default laravel import were:
# Models/ListItem.php
# Controllers/TodoListController.php
# views/welcome.blade.php
# routes/web.php

#For this project to work, you will need to create a database with the name  "todoList" and configure the database to be used in the .env file
#Also you need to do the migrations
